# fpc-esp-freertos
This project is for creating bindings to the [ESP-IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) project
of Espressif for [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org/).  --This project is targeting bindings for [version 4.1](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/release/v4.1) of 
the ESP-IDF, the latest release candidate when the project started.  Since this is a work in progress the ESP-IDF version targeted will 
be fixed at 4.1 for now.~~

~~Support for the ESP8266_RTOS_SDK [version 3.3](https://github.com/espressif/ESP8266_RTOS_SDK/tree/release/v3.3) is also being added. At the moment there is very little shared code between the two SDK's.--

## Update notice
This project is in the process of moving to esp-idf v4.3 and ESP8266_RTOS_SDK v3.4.
The previous version is still available in th ev1.0 branch.
