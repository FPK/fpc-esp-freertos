# ADC
This example demonstrates the following:
* Check if calibration for ADC is available in efuse.
* Configure ADC1 for channel 6 (GPIO34 on ESP32).
* Take average of 64 readings, print raw value and converted voltage.
* Preliminary support for the ESP32-S2 core is included but is untested.
* Repeat loop approximately every second.
